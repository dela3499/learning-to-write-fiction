# Unschooled

"Hugh Seart?" the volunteer asked. Probably the mother of a local student, she was helping contestants navigate the sprawling high school in the confusion of competition day. 

Hugh waved from across the room, and followed her to the hallway. 

"How are you feeling today? Excited?" she asked, trying to ease his nerves as they walked. 

"Alright. I've practiced, but I'm feeling a bit jittery. How about you?" he said. 

"Oh, I'm doing alright. Are you from England?" she asked. 

"No, I grew up in New York, and my parents are from Italy." he said, which was true. His British accent, though, was false. It made him less nervous, like he was a different person. It also slowed and clarified his fast mumbling, which were no good for delivering speeches. 

They talked awhile, and the woman grew more confused at his accent. Somehow, the idea that it was an act or a joke didn't cross her mind, or she felt it too socially dangerous to suggest it was a fake.

Ill-prepared, Hugh flunked exams on history, math, and economics. He was actually quite good at these subjects in school, but the focus here was mostly on memorizing useless facts. 

At one point, as he dried his hands in the restroom, another student came up to him, flustered. "Hey! What was the GDP of Uruguay in 1998?" he asked. 

"Sorry. I'm not sure." Hugh said, suddenly skeptical of his chances of success in this competition, for that's precisely the kind of knowledge he'd ignored, and and would continue to ignore. 

Hugh was prepared, by nature, for a few things though. His interview, prepared speech, and improvised speech were all delivered smoothly as a confident, though counterfeit, Londoner. Top score on his team.

Some weeks later, he'd been told to report to Ms. Gade's room for a briefing on the end-of-year assembly. Along with a few other students, he was supposed to give a speech. 

"Hi Hugh." she said, somehow already tired of him and his attitude. She cut to it. 

"I wanted to go some rules for your speech. It's my job to make sure things go smoothly. This assembly is not a joke, and I don't want it to be treated like one." she said. 

Hugh nodded, unsure why he already seemed in trouble. He'd hardly even spoken to her before. 

"I heard about your little stunt at academic decathlon. Were you trying to sabotage your team? I mean, really. What were you thinking? Talking in a British accent!" she paused. 

Tense and defensive, Hugh tried to remain expressionless.

She continued. "Listen, this event is for the students and parents to celebrate the end of the year, and if you even think about embarrassing me and this school, I'll be up on that stage so fast, you won't get two words out. You'll look stupid, so don't even try it."

Hugh stammered a bit, trying to explain that he'd gotten the best score on the team, and that nerves had pushed him to it, not malice. Half a mumbled sentence was all she could take. She'd made her point, and the conversation was therefore over.

"Wow. Well, it's your speech, and you earned it. As far as I'm concerned, you can say whatever you want. If you want to talk with a British accent, I think that'd be great. It'll probably be the best part of the whole event... these things are so boring anyway." said Mrs. Ressers, on hearing of Ms. Gade's rant. 

"Uh-huh." Hugh appreciated his math teacher's support, but the speech was now just depressing to think about. 

A bit later, the afterschool math study group had assembled, and Mrs. Ressers made an announcement. 

"For the last few months, I've been working with a school in the city that's a bit unusual. I'd like to tell you a little bit about it. It doesn't have classes or grades, and it's not really even a school. It is focused on learning, though, and I think you all might be interested in going next year. Instead of doing your junior and senior years here, you'd do them there. Next week, I'm going to take some students to visit, and you're all welcome to come." she said.

Six months later, it was Thursday at the Spark Center. Demo day. Hugh sat among 50 other Sparkers, as they were called. He was deep in several projects, but today was a day to hear what other people were working on. 

"Hi, I'm Krista, and over the last few weeks, I've been writing a short ebook on the current music scene in Manhattan. I've got a little history in it, but it's mainly a guidebook, catalog, and reference manual. Venues, practice locations, prices, phone numbers, pictures. It's all in here. Or, a lot of it is!" 

She eventually reached her five-minute limit, and along came another. 

"My name's Chris, and I've been learning to record podcasts this month. So, I put together a field manual, and a little online bundle you can buy to get you started for around $100. I've compared a bunch of different podcasting styles and equipment, and it's all on my blog. I'll show you some of it... here." he brought up his tests, and soon his five minutes were over too. 

On it went for about an hour, and after the last demo, the group disbanded in scattered conversations, putting the chairs away and seeking out the last remaining snacks. 

This was a world where you really couldn't predict what each week would bring. Not for you, or for anyone else. Speeches could be delivered as songs or raps if felt the need. Not a school, indeed.
