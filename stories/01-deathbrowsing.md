# Deathbrowsing

Monty Python, cats, tv shows, scrabble. A full life by John's standard, and time to leave the earthly plane. His riches would buy him a stylish death, he thought. On to Stopbox, celebrated as the innovative death shop, the Apple store for life-ending devices and experiences. 

"What's your most comical death?" he asked the cheerful reaper at the entrance. 

The scent of a commission made his response bold. "Depends on your sense of humor, I guess. Skydive into a donut made of concrete. Walk off backward off a cliff while guiding some unsuspecting tourists. We can arrange all sorts of things." 

"I'm an impulse buyer, but I'd like to see more options. Mind if I just spin the wheel?" John said. 

John spun the gaudy, enormous Wheel of Endings in the center of the room, and ended up on a perfectly passable perishing - baking a cake in a volcano. 

Turning around the image in his mind, John said, "Hmmm. Red velvet on... Mount Vesuvius!"
