# Symmetry

Starship Voyager repaired the damage it had done to the living nebula, and escaped into warp. The credits rolled. 

Joseph's mind left the screen, if it was ever there, and he approached the exit. His stomach was pulsating with fear and uncertainty. He entered the lobby to see his doppelganger doing the same. The two different episodes they'd just watched would ostensibly give them something new to talk about, given their memories and minds were identical. 

Still, he doubted forks ever started their relationship by discussing the symmetry-breakers. How could an episode of television eclipse the sudden appearance of a person just like you? 

"Joseph, meet Jose." said the attendant as he left them to talk. 

"How do you feel about Sarah?" asked Joseph. 

Jose smirked, and thought for a second. "Let's see, fond..." he trailed off with a knowing glance. Sarah was his first girlfriend, and Joseph's too. Memories of her were identical in each of them, so she was the ex of both of them in a way. 

They remained a while in the lobby, testing their memory against each other. Satisfied, they left and began to consider how to spend the next month, full of ideas.
