# Universal acid

The pomodoro timer went off, and Rick took to the stairwell for some exercise. 

Ring. To the stairwell. 

Ring. Snack. 

Ring. Lunchtime. 

He walked across campus to the hidden benches no one seemed to visit. Deer watched his approach from the ditch. 

He thought to himself. "I should come out here for lunch every day. It's restful. I just realized how tense and stressed I was at the lab. It'll be nice when Christmas break comes."

The workday continued, split by many calisthenic interruptions. They seemed to return him only to half-sanity, and the effect lasted just a few minutes. The sharp doubts rejoined him as he struggled at his computer. His labmates seemed happy, focused, and productive. He wished he felt that way.

"So, what are your plans?" asked the professor, while the four of them shared a dinner table. 

"I'm heading out Thursday, and will be back on the first. I'll be checking my email and stuff though. I'll see if I can finish the methods section on the autoencoder paper." said someone. 

"I'll be back on the third. I might play around with the diffusion simulation while I'm gone." said another. 

"You'll be checking your email, right?" asked the professor, with his eyes narrowed a bit. He fidgeted in his seat beside a large vanilla latte - his trademark beverage. 

"Yeah. I always keep it open." came the response. 

"And you, Rick?" he asked. 

"I'm planning to be back on the 6th, but I'll be on retreat for ten days, so I'll be incommunicado - no phone or computer." Rick answered. 

"Oh? So, no email or anything... can you come back earlier then?" asked the professor. 

"Unfortunately not. That's just when the retreat ends." Rick said. 

Annoyed, the professor hesitated for a second, and decided to ditch the subject. He just turned aside and got some updates about another project.

On the rural retreat grounds, Rick spend his hours alternately sitting in meditation and lying in thought. Each day passed silently, without a phone, computer, or even a pencil. As directed, he even avoided eye contact with the other meditators. Everything was structured to reproduce the conditions of a solitary mountain retreat. 

Each hour, he battled a thousand thoughts and urges in order to remain focused on his breath and body. It was all too easy to fidget, or get lost in some thought. Here, the goal was to maintain a singular focus, and to sit perfectly still. He improved each day. 

To Rick, thought was a beautiful thing, and he seemed to find the purest form of it in the rest periods between meditations. 

Avoiding the sleep-inducing effect of perfect stillness, he'd fidget his legs, and think deeply atop his foam mattress.

Away from the pressures of a supervisor or the technical problems of the lab, he'd enter into multi-hour Socratic dialogues with himself. At the end of these sessions, he'd have gotten a much clearer picture of whatever it was he'd considered. 

These sessions made his thought seem like universal acid, able to burn through anything. No matter the topic, he could lie down and expect progress. It was exhilarating.
