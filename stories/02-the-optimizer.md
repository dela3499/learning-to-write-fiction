# The Optimizer
Musk paced the immense length of the Gigafactory with the New York Times reporter, James, and his film crew. 

"It's the largest building on Earth, by volume, and produces more lithium-ion batteries than all other factories in the world combined." he said. 

The hourlong interview and tour led them to superhuman-speed welding robots, presses, extruders, stampers, and novel devices still without names. Things moved so quickly that little could be seen except in slowed-down videos of the production line. 

James said, "Well, it's been a pleasure to see this groundbreaking work, and I hope to-"

An imperceptible rumble shook beneath them.

James continued, hiding his nerves. "to see more factories like it when you start to expand. Thank you for the tour."

"Yeah, it was great to have you." Musk said as they all approached the main entrance. 

Musk broke off to take a call as they left, and James's shaking was hidden only by his fast walk toward the getaway van.

David burst into the darkness of the Gigafactory basement. His fear and curiosity multiplied when he saw that massive spools of thin steel wire lined the walls, lit only by his halogen lamp. He set down his gear, and began taking photographs.

Silent and invisible, a drone approached his infrared form and fired.

His cameras and lights gone, he awoke and sneered at Musk, "It's true, then. You are an optimizer. Tesla, SpaceX, everything. It's all a front. It's all devoted to..." 

He trailed off as he saw Musk grab a single paper clip from his desk drawer, and set it on the burning incandescent bulb of his desk lamp. 

"Hold out your hand." Musk said. He placed the red hot loop of metal there, and shut David's hand into a tight fist, searing his flesh.  

He continued. "When you get back, tell Bezos I'm going to enjoy turning him into paper clips."
