# Cold Feet

Stewardesses on Iceland's Wow Air seem to pride themselves on their looks and disposition. Tan, cheerful, and wearing suits and skirts of purple-pink, they walked the plane's aisles. Atop their tightly wrapped hair, they each wore caps seemingly stolen from midcentury sailors and dyed the color of their crisp, authoritative purple-pink uniforms. 

Having just read about the Rejection Challenge, I flagged down the passing stewardess. 

"Could I try on your hat?" I asked, smiling. 

Confused, she kneeled and listened closely, still warm and cheerful, as I repeated the question. She said something, disappeared for a few minutes, and returned to place her hat ceremoniously in my hands. I had her take my picture, and then she went back to her duties with a smirk. I'd pride myself on my flirting skills, but her wedding ring suggested her laughter and warmth was probably more professional than romantic. Still, it's not like flight attendants work for tips, so I shouldn't sell myself too short.

Five hours later, I was in Keflavik. Another hour, and I was in Reykjavik, Iceland's capital city. In fact, I was later told it was it's *only* city, and that the towns around Iceland actually take offense if called cities. 

Having just come from a few windy February weeks in New York city, I thought I'd be prepared for Iceland's cold. After all, Iceland's green and Greenland's icy, right? Not quite. The walk from the bus station to my hostel was so cold, and my shoes so thin and snow-soaked, that I had to interrupt my walk every few minutes to pretend to shop in the stores of the quaint downtown Reykjavik. Evening was approaching, and this was the first time in my life that actually posed an existential risk. I hurried home.

I warmed myself on arriving at the hostel, and a group UK nurses shared their recent adventures with me. They'd just raced a blizzard to the hostel, escaping a tiny village before the roads closed, and driving in the darkness on roads visible only as the space between reflective roadside poles. I decided I wouldn't be renting a car while I was there. Certainly not alone anyway. Beyond those poles lay many things. Sometimes a snowy plateau, or a slope, or a thin sheet of ice over water that would crack and envelop any car that fell upon it.

I eventually made it out to the sights with a midwestern couple used to driving in snowy conditions. I successfully protected myself from the cold and wet with ten dollars-worth of trashbags and electrical tape. I think I gave some Korean tourists a good show when I tested my homespun solution by running past them toward a semi-frozen waterfall.
