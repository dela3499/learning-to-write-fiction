# Death Spud
"Hi honey! HOw are you? " she said, after ipicking up the ptelephone. 

"I'm doing fine. What about you? " he asked.

"Well, you know... I'm actually fin feeling a bit odd this week. A little down, though I'm not sure why." she said. 

That's ah hardling hardly a surprise --
I'm not surprised. Y' You've been saying that fo r for the last 50 years, es every single week I cal  call you. 

"What a surprise! I hope s you start to be feel better, mother. Is there anything i Ic I can do? " he asked. 

"No. Not really. It's just my neck is statrt starting to get reall quite sore, and then I have a hard time reading. You know how much I love r to read, dear. Anyway, then my shoulder gett gett gets thsi this terrible stabbing pain in it, so I can hardly move. You don't want to hear about this anyway. This is just my life, though. Sometimes, I feel it would be better tj to just end it, you know? " she said. 

"I thought you had the art-- The arr arthritis medit pills don't work, then? Maybe we can - Maybe you can get some better onne ones?" he said. 

"Oh. It's hardly work worth it. I won't be around much longer anyway. You'll miss me we when I'm gone , you know. You'er always darting around from here to there, and spending all your time with you r can cats , but your mother is here too, at least for a little while, and .. anyway. " she said. 

"Well, I have an idea for you, if you'd like to hear it. I think you'll find it helpulf helpful in addressing your problems." John sadi said. 

"Oh? What is the idea? I don't really think I ca could stomach any more pills at this point, and exercise s is out t of the question, dear.-" she said. 

"No no no. I have a much t simpler idea. What I was thinking is, that, if you wanted to, and again, only if you wanted, I could stop by next week, and kill you. Again, ta that's only if you wanted me too to. " she he offered. 

Silence for a few moments. 

Then she hl howled with laughter. 

"Dear, what a bold idea, but I think I can hold i on a little longer, dest despite the pains. e Great grandkids are stopping by next month, and they'll want to hear some stories, so maybe after that. I'll keep it in mind e dear!" she said.

Sarh Sarah know knocked on h the front door, and Gretchen answered. 

"Dear, dear, dear, come in !" and let's see, heree Jim and little sweetie Pam!" she said. 

They all walked to the living room, som e fast and some slow. 

"How's your week been, mother?" arke asked a Sarh Sarah. 

"Feeling a bit down, you know..." she continued for a while. Aches, pains, existential woe, and so on. "but, you know, John said he'd come next week to murder x kill me,so I m lok looking forward to that. Go meet Jesus and whatnot." 

Little Jim looked up from his games and asked, "What did you do? Why are you going to get killed? "

"Oh no reason. It's just I've been feeling a little down, and all that , so John offered to serve me some potatoes that will make me sleepy. So sleepy that I'm never d going to wake up. " She said. 

---

"I'm coming over with the tot potatoes, mother!" j John shouted from the kitchensx kitchen. 

They both ate, and sat fr for a while, playing a lopsided game of Scrabble. 

"Thanks dear, I think x "Oh x "

I' "I'm getting awesfully sleepin sp sleepy from those potaoesx potatoesr, John. " she said. 

I "I can't guessx "I'd saix say it was the scrabble that's wro wroth worn you out, but I'll stick r around a while reading while you take a nap, and we can gte  get dinner later. " he said. 

She went for a nap, and a bit before dinner time, work woke up. My dear, what is tha tx

s I tohu thouhgt thought I wasn't supposed to wake up... 

"John. John!" she started to get louder. 

W' What's wrong mother? Are you alright? Need a pillow fu ful ful fluffing?" she  he said. 

"I thought the potatoes were gong going to kill me!" she said. 

"I thought you liked them well enough when you ate them. They're fondant, french potatoes, anyway. I thought they were d good, at least." he said, hurt. 

"Thy They wree were poin poin pos poisoned, right? " she asked. 

"H No. Oh! Did yu you want me to poin poison them? I guess I could try to mash up some pills in it if you want. I'm nt not sure which pils pills to mash in there." he said.
