# Problem-Solving vs. Problem-Having

I love a good conversation or debate, but sometimes I find myself in a bad one. What makes the difference? 

A good conversation involves both listening and speaking. It's a *two-way* communication. It's optimistic. It involves clarifying ideas and seeking solutions to problems. Even if the subject of conversation is dark, the underlying motivation is a good one - to improve the situation. 

In a good conversation, both people are engaged. They're trying to point out flaws in each others' ideas. They're searching their memories for relevant arguments and experiences. It's liberating, fun, and exciting. These conversations are a treasure, and great ones are rare. 

Bad conversations are the opposite. They're one-sided, pessimistic, and repetitive. No matter the subject, things quickly take on a tone of victimhood and complaint. There are problems, and no solutions. These conversations quickly make me tense and uneasy, so I leave them as quickly as I can. 

Maybe I'm too sensitive, and see the world as a more cheerful place than it is. Maybe the pessimists are more objective. 

I think not. Though I'm ignorant of many evils, I share my outlook with people that've seen far worse. This outlook is about problem-solving, no matter how bad the problem. On the other hand, the mindset that underlies a bad conversation is about *problem-having*. It's about how bad things are, not about how they could be made better. 

Perhaps this seems like an superficial difference, but I think it's deep. Who will make progress and improve things in practice? Will it be the one who can learn from others, trade ideas, and enjoys seeking solutions? Or will it be the one who speaks without listening, repeats their complaints, and is bored by the offer of solutions? Who would you rather be? Would you rather have a problem, or solve it? 

I think life is much richer, more interesting, and more fun when you take seriously the principles offered by David Deutsch in his book, The Beginning of Infinity:

1. All evils are due to lack of knowledge. 
2. Problems are inevitable. 
3. Problems are soluble. 

We need to know more, be prepared to confront difficulties, and try to overcome those difficulties when they arise. These are the values and attitudes that encourage progress.
