# The modern world through a Luddite's eyes

As a programmer, I almost never meet modern-day Luddites - people who dislike the internet, computers, and technology generally. It's a culture shock when I do. 

What's their view of the digital world? In a recent conversation, I got one perspective:

*The digital world is an escape from the real one, where you can pretend to be an explorer or a king while tapping buttons in a tiny room. It's made up, and the rules are designed for your pleasure, while the real world is less accommodating. In the real world, you can make discoveries, and things are open-ended. There are no guarantees, and there are real adventures to be had.*

The big misconception here is that the digital world contains only games. It actually contains much more than only games, including many things which help in the physical world. 

I thought I'd take a minute to review the digital world I inhabit and interact with. The world that Luddites ignore. 

1. **Communication** How do I keep in touch with other people? Text and Facebook messages, email, phone calls/Skype. 

2. **Information** Where do I get my information? Google & Twitter. 

3. **Learning** How do I learn things? Blogs, Kindle books, online courses, Wikipedia. 

4. **Entertainment** What do I do to relax? Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Music. 

5. **Travel** How do I get around? Uber/Lyft, Google Flights, Google Maps, Airbnb. 

While this isn't an exhaustive list, it contains the things I use most often, and which are all foreign to Luddites. Does it matter? I think so. 

With these tools, I can communicate with anyone basically for free, in small ways or large. I can learn many things for free, and everything else for very little. Entertainment's cheap and available on demand. I can carry a library of books with me. I can live without a car, find cheap flights, and never get lost. 

Still, this list doesn't quite capture life in the digital world. When you put all these things together, life is very different. The problems you face are different. Some problems, like getting lost, simply go away. You feel much more confident, because there are so many resources for learning things. You never feel stuck. You're not a hostage to your own ideas. The Luddite life lacks these tools, and seems needlessly difficult, isolated, and uncomfortable. 

I like having access to the digital world.
