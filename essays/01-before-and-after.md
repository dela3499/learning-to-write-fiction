# Before & After 

When someone commits to losing weight or getting stronger, they'll often take a 'before' picture, eat well and exercise for a time, and then take an 'after' picture. This general approach applies to more than fitness. I'm applying it to writing, for instance. 

At the end of October, I went to an event kicking off National Novel Writing Month, or *Nanowrimo* for short. Every year, thousands of people commit to writing a 50,000+ word novel in November, so I thought I'd join them. 

Two weeks in, today is the first time I've written anything. Why did it take me so long? When I tried the top-down approach (plan first, then write), I'd spend all this time planning, and never writing anything. When I tried the bottom-up approach (just start writing without a plan), I found myself writing boring, aimless nonsense. 

So, what finally got me to write something? I decided to write short stories. Three a day. That way, I could have something to show for each day's work, try out lots of different ideas, and not pretend that I know how to write yet. By writing and publishing every day, I'd be practicing all sorts of important fiction-writing skills, and improving much more rapidly than if I was writing the novel. 

My goal switched from *writing a novel* to *learning to write fiction*. This totally released all the pressure. I could focus on a few stories each day, and have no problem if they were terrible. The whole point of a 'before' picture is that it's bad. In fact, the worse the 'before' picture is, the more impressive the 'after' picture is. So, my first few short stories serve as my 'before' picture. At the end of the month, instead of having tried (and probably failed) to write a good novel, I'll have an 'after' picture - a set of short stories that blow my first ones out of the water. 

What are the fundamental principles? 

1. Something to show after every day's work. 
2. Lots of individual, visible attempts to make progress. 
3. Snapshots all along the way, especially at the start and finish. 

This process makes it hard *not* to improve.
