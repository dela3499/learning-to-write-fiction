# Stick to a Routine

It sounds obvious, but life is haphazard without a routine. In my own case, my work remains unfinished until late in the day, if it is finished at all. I fall dead asleep with a headache and blurry eyes after hours of Youtube and Netflix. I don't learn as much as I'd like. I feel frustrated and scattered. It's not fun, but it comes to seem normal after a while. 

My current routine solves these problems, and I can actually stick to it. 

Here it is.

- 6 - wake up & exercise
- 8 - work
- 12 - eat a social lunch
- 2 - learn something new
- 5 - take a walk
- 6 - plan for what's ahead
- 7 - disconnect from work
- 10 - sleep 

The specifics aren't that important, but this provides me with a basic structure. I'm able to improvise and adjust things on any given day, but the basic structure works. I'm alert in the morning, I cool down in the evening, the most intellectually challenging parts of day (work, learning, and planning) are separated by breaks. 

As an aside, you probably don't want to be too detailed in your routine. Just block off multi-hour chunks for various purposes. If your routine too detailed, it's hard to keep track of things, and you probably won't stick to it. 

Here are a few things I like about having a routine. 

### It lets me build up multple habits at a time. 
Normally, you're supposed to build up one habit a time. I'm impatient with that sort of thing, but I find myself able to adhere to a good schedule. That means I'm improving my work, sleep, and learning habits all at once. 

###  It encourages me to make time for what's important.
Instead of simply having goals, I schedule them into my day. "*Learn something new from 2-5pm.*" is better than "*Learn something new today.*"

Try sticking to a routine, and see if it helps you make more progress.
