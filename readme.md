# Learning to write
Inspiried by Nanowrimo, I decided to start writing fiction this month. While I'm at it, I'll also practice writing nonfiction. You can find my successive learning attempts here. 

# Fiction

In practicing fiction, I'm writing a few stories a day, spending an hour on each one, trying out lots of different approaches, and hoping to improve my skills in the process. You can find my stories below! Feel free to offer any feedback.
